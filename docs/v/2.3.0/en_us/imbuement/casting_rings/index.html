      <meta property="og:description" content="One of the main limitations that has kept me from making a ring to cast with is that the ring would be much too small and perhaps even inefficient. However now that I&#39;m reviewing these texts I can see workarounds that at least limit the ring&#39;s negative effects. Some materials apparently have special interactions with media. Two examples of such materials are documented on the next page." />
