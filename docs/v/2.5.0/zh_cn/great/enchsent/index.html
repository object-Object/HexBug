      <meta property="og:description" content="Whilst being hunted by a particularly strong group of 30-40 people consisting of professional hitmen or assassins, bounty hunters, and other mages looking to vanquish him, the mage had escaped into a castle. He needed a way to be able to deal with all of them from a huge distance or from a few floors up. Greater Sentinel&#39;s range was much too small, they would be aware it was a small trap. So out of desperation, he looked to his Amel to &#34;enchant&#34; the pattern." />
