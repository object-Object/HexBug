      <meta property="og:description" content="Whilst being hunted by a particularly strong group of 30-40 people consisting of professional hitmen or assassins, bounty hunters, and other mages looking to vanquish them, the mage had escaped into a castle. They needed a way to be able to deal with all of them from a huge distance or from a few floors up. Greater Sentinel had a small area, thus small corridors would be suspicious. So out of desperation, they looked to their Amel to &#34;enchant&#34; the pattern." />
