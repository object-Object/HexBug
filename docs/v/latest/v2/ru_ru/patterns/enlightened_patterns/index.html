      <meta property="og:description" content="After Enlightenment, I find myself acutely aware of certain patterns that aid with my newfound abilities. These patterns don&#39;t seem to require anything from me that I didn&#39;t have before; perhaps I was always able to cast them but was simply unaware of their existence. An unenlightened player will be able to use casting devices with these patterns." />
