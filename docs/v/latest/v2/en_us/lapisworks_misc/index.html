      <meta property="og:description" content="These ancient texts recount an old and wise wizard, extremely knowledgeable of all sorcery, yet spiteful of all creatures living, dead, undead or unborn. It is told he was poor in sources of media and many came after him, but he always managed to survive. This wizard left behind a treasure trove of knowledge on his demise (collected by curious adventurers) including Enchanted Patterns.Will I ever be capable of this feat?" />
