      <meta property="og:description" content="Gates are the latest in my long line of experimentation with breaking space to connect distant points and allow instantaneous travel. What gates allow me to do, that none of my previous attempts have succeeded at, is to do it efficiently. There are three varieties of gates that I have learned how to construct, all of which take a large amount of media to burn into reality, but are significantly cheaper to operate afterwards." />
