      <meta property="og:description" content="Items are not the only places I can store information, however. I am also able to store that information in the media of the Hex itself, much like the stack, but separate. Texts refer to this as the ravenmind. It holds a single iota, much like a Focus, and begins with Null like the same. It is preserved between iterations of Thoth&#39;s Gambit, but only lasts as long as the Hex it&#39;s a part of. Once I stop casting, the value will be lost." />
