      <meta property="og:description" content="While it is possible to produce most iotas on the fly, there are cases where one finds it impractical, or simply cannot (such as very large and precise numbers, or entity references), and as such must obtain the desired iota in another way. Reading it from a Focus or a similar item works just fine, but in many cases this would require a third hand, which I do not have. Other methods of fetching iotas from external locations have their own limitations as well." />
