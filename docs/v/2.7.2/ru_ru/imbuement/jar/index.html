      <meta property="og:description" content="My new tools are fun to play around with, and the Amel being able to be drawn from the hotbar is also convenient. However.. I find that some things in this field require a rather inconvenient amount of Amel to carry. For example: the partially-infused staves, while they grant me a larger hex grid, need constant repairing with Amel. Another example is the Enchant X patterns, which require a bunch of Amel as well. They make my pockets ever fuller. I cannot make much space for other things as my hands and my hotbar are unfortunately full. Indeed, I must acquire a solution." />
