      <meta property="og:description" content="I have learned never to open those texts that require a broken mind again. They disturb my psyche tremendously, likely due to some password being required that had since been lost to time. My psyche. They touched my sanity. They tried to hurt me at my pinnacle. How dare they? HOW DARE THEY?! Stop. Keep calm. Focus. Move on. History will have taught them their error in their demise." />
